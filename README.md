# xkb symbols reference
This a cheatsheatsheet for editing xkb files. The symbols listed here are those that I need and use.
I made it as a little help for me to port [Dvorak by Nizo](https://github.com/theNizo/DvorakByNizo-German) to Linux.
if you want to list more characters, feel free to send me a list and I'll add them.
