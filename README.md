# xkb Symbols Reference
This a cheatsheatsheet for editing xkb files. The symbols listed here are those that I need and use.
I made it as a little help for me to port [Dvorak by Nizo](https://github.com/theNizo/DvorakByNizo-German) to Linux.
if you want to list more characters, feel free to send me a list and I'll add them.
Just in case, no guarantee that it's correct, but if something should be changed, let me know.

Please Note that this text is formatted to support markdown view. Viewing this as a raw file might be confusing.
